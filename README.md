Description:
This is a feature told from the perspective of the person who is requesting the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. People with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. This website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.
